🚀 How to Add Members to a GitHub Project Board

✅ If your project is under a personal repo:

You can’t add members directly to the project, but you can: 1. Invite them as collaborators to the repo:
• Go to your repo → Settings → Collaborators.
• Click “Add people”, enter their GitHub username or email, and invite.
• Once accepted, they can view and edit the Project board. 2. Once they’re collaborators:
• Go to your repo’s Projects tab.
• Open your project.
• They should now have access to view/edit cards and issues.
